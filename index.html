  <p style="color:red;">Sasori, born in the village hidden in the sand from the manga/anime called Naurto. In the serious Sasori is one of the few
    main enemies throughout the book/series with always being brought up in the beginning. One of the few main villains throughout
    the story. Sasori started off when his backstory showing him starting off as a child that was only wishing for an actual family.
    He was shown the skill of puppetry by his grandmother chiyo. Sasoir made literal copies of his deceased parents so he could then
    control the puppets to be like his parents. With the love of puppets for him began the work to have more and develop himself into
    the ultimate puppet, so he began going down a dark path once hitting a certain age. Sasori was a villain you could feel a bit of pity and just wonder
    what could of become of him if he hadn't gone down the dark route he ended up with.
