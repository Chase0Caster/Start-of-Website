Sasoir was born in the sand village, soon after birth had lost both parents. He was then taken in by Chiyo- his grandmother.
With the loneliness that follows without having true love from parents he grew distant, because of this Chiyo decided teach him
about the art of puppets. Sasori excelled in the art and soon after went rather quickly into it as he'd quickly learn how control up
to two puppets quickly while at a young age. These puppets ended up being rather close coppies to his own parents' as Sasori would
try get the connections one get from actual parents but such came to never help. Sasori gave the parent puppets to Chiyo before
going back crafting other ingenus puppets.
